# Should I use an iFrame?
An age old question for certain. We know that like the sirens of old, the iFrame's call can be aluring. You may find yourself justifying their use because of convenience or deadlines or any other number of factors.

When faced with these moments, we wanted to provide a website that would help you reflect on the choice you are facing, and hopefully help you move forward in a way that you, your coworkers, and all of humanity can look back on with pride.
